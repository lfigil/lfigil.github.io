# Tableau ~ Analyzing Airbnb Data

# **Project Proposal**

- **Executive Summary:** The objective of this project is to analyze the Airbnb dataset to optimize pricing strategies for hosts, ultimately maximizing their rental income and occupancy rates. By leveraging historical data on property listings, bookings, and pricing, the project aims to provide insights and recommendations to hosts, enabling them to set competitive prices and attract more guests. The project's specific outcomes include developing a user-friendly visualization or data story platform that offers pricing insights, trends, and recommendations based on the analysis.
- **Target Audience:** The final presentation is intended for Airbnb hosts, specifically those who want to enhance their pricing strategies to increase rental income and occupancy rates. The primary persona, Sarah Anderson, represents this target audience and has goals such as maximizing earnings, maintaining high occupancy rates, and gaining a competitive advantage.
- **Dataset Selection:** The chosen dataset is Jersey City Airbnb dataset, which contains information on property listings, prices, host details, and reviews. This dataset was selected due to its relevance to the business goal of optimizing pricing strategies for hosts. It provides comprehensive information that can be leveraged to identify pricing trends, analyze competitive landscapes, and make data-driven recommendations.
- **Initial Presentation Approach:** The findings will be presented through an interactive web-based platform. The presentation will include visualizations such as price trends over time, occupancy rates, and comparisons with similar properties in the area. It will offer recommendations on pricing ranges, popular booking periods, and tips on adjusting prices for seasonal variations or events. The platform will be designed to be user-friendly, providing hosts like Sarah with actionable insights and empowering them to make informed pricing decisions.
- **Challenges and Areas for Experience:** Foreseeable challenges include accurately predicting demand fluctuations, incorporating dynamic market conditions, and addressing the uniqueness of each property. Gaining experience in data analysis techniques, visualization tools, and developing effective pricing recommendations will be essential. Peers' insights on tackling these challenges, refining visualization techniques, and leveraging advanced analytics methods are welcome.
